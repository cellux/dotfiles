1. Inventory the functions in `rb-ts.el` that currently lack tests, focusing on selectors (`rb-ts--resolve-node`), listing/getting nodes, parse helpers, and update/insert operations.
2. Build reusable fixtures (e.g., multi-form Emacs Lisp files) and helper expectations to drive Tree-sitter parsing while keeping the tests fast in memory.
3. Write ERT tests that exert each helper under both success and failure conditions, ensuring they correctly accept selectors, surface diagnostics, honor formatting/dry-run switches, and parse/re-parse files before persisting edits.
4. Verify the new tests run cleanly (skipping when Tree-sitter language support is missing) and document the approach so future contributors know how to exercise this suite.
