Add two GPTel tools to insert text before or after a Tree-sitter node, anchoring by node hash or start line. The tools must locate the target node, compute the insertion offset safely, modify the file atomically, optionally indent the inserted region, and validate parse success. They should fail on missing/ambiguous selectors or malformed inserts, and return useful range/context info. Provide ERT coverage and documentation consistent with existing rb-tools conventions.
