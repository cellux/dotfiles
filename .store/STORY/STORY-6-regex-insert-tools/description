Introduce two GPTel helpers, insert_before_regex and insert_after_regex, to perform targeted insertions relative to simple regex matches using ripgrep’s default regex syntax. The tools should locate the closest match to a requested line, insert the given text before or after that match in a temporary buffer, and atomically replace the file contents only if the change succeeds. When validation is requested, reparse the file with Tree-sitter before writing to ensure no syntax issues are introduced. Helpers must fail when the regex is not found or ambiguous and should describe the insert range in their return data.
