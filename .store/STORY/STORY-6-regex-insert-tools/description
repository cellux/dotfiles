As a maintainer of the dotfiles toolkit I need a reliable way to insert text immediately before or after a specific line identified by a regex rather than brittle absolute offsets. This lets GPTel agents and me reason about edits in terms of nearby markers (comments, section headers, function signatures) and avoid corrupting surrounding forms.

The new tools must support the following:

- run edits in a temporary buffer so the original file is untouched until we’re confident about the change
- optionally re-parse the temp buffer with Tree-sitter when the `:validate` flag is provided so syntax errors are caught before the file is overwritten

Regex patterns must follow the same flavor that ripgrep uses in its default mode (Rust regex) so GPTel users can reuse patterns across tools without surprises.
