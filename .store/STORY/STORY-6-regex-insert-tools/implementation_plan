1. Build low-level helpers in `rb-tools.el` that locate the canonical match for a regex. If there are several matches but there is an integer :line argument, pick the match that is closest to :line. If the match has been successfully identified, capture its line number, and return the adjacent insertion point (before or after that line). Ensure the helpers work on the raw file text and report an error if the regex is ambiguous or absent. Document that the regex flavor matches ripgrep’s default (Rust) so callers can write compatible expressions.
2. Implement `insert_after_regex` and `insert_before_regex` as GPTel tools using those helpers. Each tool must open the file in a temporary buffer, perform the insertion with precise newline handling, and—when the `:validate` flag is true—re-parse the buffer with Tree-sitter before writing. The tools should raise errors on missing matches, ambiguous occurrences, validation failures, or any other failure modes instead of silently misapplying edits.
3. Write ERT regression tests in `rb-tools-test.el` that exercise both tools: success cases (insert before/after a unique marker, select the match closest to an explicit anchor line when multiple occurrences exist, and demonstrate the regex syntax matches ripgrep’s default mode) and failure cases (missing regex, ambiguous target, validation failure). Document the new tools alongside the existing GPTel helper listings so authors know how to call them and how `:line` and `:validate` behave.
