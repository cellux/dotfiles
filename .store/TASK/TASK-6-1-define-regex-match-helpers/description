Define pure helper functions in rb-tools.el that locate the unique regex match closest to an optional anchor line. The helpers should shell out to ripgrep to find the regex matches, handle no-match and ambiguous-match cases, and return the absolute line number plus the offset immediately before and after the matched line so callers can decide where to insert. Document the expected arguments (`path`, `regex`, `line` optional) and the error conditions (missing file, missing match, multiple equally-close matches). These helpers will be shared by both insert_before_regex and insert_after_regex, and their regex syntax must match ripgrep’s default Rust flavor so downstream validators know what patterns are legal.
