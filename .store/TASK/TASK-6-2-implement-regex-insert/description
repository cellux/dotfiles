Add rb-tools.el helpers that search for :regex in the target file via ripgrep (default syntax), pick the match closest to :line, and insert :new_text either before or after the matching line. Implement the temporary buffer workflow: copy the file contents, perform the insertion at the right position, then, when :validate t is given, reparse the modified buffer with Tree-sitter to ensure syntax validity before overwriting the file. The functions should raise descriptive errors when the file is missing, the regex cannot be compiled/found, or if validation fails, and should ensure no partial writes occur. Document they expect ripgrep default regex syntax and wire them up through gptel-make-tool with consistent descriptions and return data.
