Write ERT tests that directly exercise the parsing helpers in `rb-ts.el`. Verify `rb-ts--node-successfully-parsed?` and `rb-ts--node-parse-errors` by feeding them roots derived from fixtures that include both valid and invalid syntax so we can assert success and the reported diagnostics. Drive `rb-ts-parse-buffer` via temporary buffers to confirm it sets the right major mode, rejects unsupported languages, and raises the parse diagnostics when Tree-sitter cannot build a valid root. Do the same for `rb-ts-with-root`, checking readable/writable guards and ensuring success when the file is valid. Skip any tests that depend on Tree-sitter languages that are not ready.
