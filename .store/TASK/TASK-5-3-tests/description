Add ERT tests covering hash-based and line-based targeting, before/after insertion, skip_format behavior, missing/ambiguous selector failure, and parse failure on malformed insert text. Use fixture files with multiple forms to ensure correct offsets and no partial writes on error.

Check the already available tests and do not duplicate what is already there.
