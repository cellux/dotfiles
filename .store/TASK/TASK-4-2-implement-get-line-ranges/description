Implement get_line_ranges Emacs tool in rb-tools.el. Validate inputs (path exists, ranges list, start/end integers, start<=end, sorted descending by start, reject overlaps, reject out-of-bounds). Sort ranges descending by start. For each range, extract exact text (no normalization), compute MD5 on raw bytes of that slice, and return list of plists with start, end, text, text_hash. Errors via (error ...) on invalid input. Remove or deprecate replace_line_ranges per design. Add docstring/comments consistent with API spec.
