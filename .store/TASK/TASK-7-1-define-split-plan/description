Replace the monolithic contents of `rb-tools.el` with a thin aggregator that merely requires `rb-tools-eval.el`, `rb-tools-ts.el`, `rb-tools-io.el`, and `rb-tools-store.el`. Leave the GPTel tool/preset definitions in place but point them at the relocated functions, ensure shared `defvar`s (Tree-sitter language map, formatting hook, IO injection points) remain visible to consumers, and add a trivial runtime check or comment verifying the aggregator still loads all modules and preserves the tool registry.
