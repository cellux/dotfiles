Create `rb-tools-io.el` and move line-range utilities, regex matching/insertion helpers, ripgrep/fd wrappers, and file read/write operations into it. Include the associated ERT tests that cover line range validation, get/update operations, regex matching/insert helpers, and text read/write helpers. Ensure the module declares its dependencies, documents how to use each helper, and is `provide`d so the aggregator can require and expose its functions to the GPTel tools without needing to duplicate logic.
