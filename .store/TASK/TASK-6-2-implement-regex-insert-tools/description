Using the helpers from `TASK-6-1-define-regex-match-helpers`, implement `insert_after_regex` and `insert_before_regex` as GPTel tools via `gptel-make-tool`. Each tool should accept `path`, `regex`, optional `line`, `new_text`, and the optional `validate` flag. Within a temporary buffer, open the file, locate the target line using the helper, insert `new_text` immediately before or after that line (respecting newline boundaries), and—if `:validate` is true—re-parse the buffer with Tree-sitter before writing. Replace the file’s content only after successful validation (if requested) and bubble helper errors when targets aren’t found or matches are ambiguous. Clearly document that regex patterns follow ripgrep’s default (Rust) syntax so authors know which expressions are accepted.
