Using the helpers from TASK-6-1, implement `insert_after_regex` and `insert_before_regex` as GPTel tools via `gptel-make-tool`. Each tool should accept `path`, `regex`, `line`, `new_text`, and optional `validate`. Within a temp buffer, open the file, locate the target line via the helper, insert `new_text` on the correct side of that line, and—if `:validate` is true—reparse the buffer with Tree-sitter before writing. Replace the file’s content only after a successful validation (if requested) and ensure the helper errors bubble up clearly when targets aren’t found or matches are ambiguous. The tools should return the usual GPTel tool metadata and any diagnostics needed to reason about the change. Reinforce in the documentation that regex patterns follow ripgrep’s default (Rust) syntax so auxiliary tooling can reuse the same expressions.
