Develop ERT tests covering `rb-ts--collect-root-children`, `rb-ts--format-list-nodes`, `rb-ts--select-nodes-by-line`, and higher-level helpers `rb-ts-list-nodes` and `rb-ts-get-nodes`. Use synthetic roots or fixtures to assert the collection returns correct indices, kinds, lines, hashes, and previews. Check that get-nodes raises errors when requesting nodes on missing lines, and verify the formatting defaults. Ensure tests skip Tree-sitter parsing when the language isn't installed.
