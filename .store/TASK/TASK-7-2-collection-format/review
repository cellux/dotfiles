Completed focused ERT coverage for the listing and selection helpers in `rb-ts.el`.

What went well:
- Added exercises for `rb-ts--collect-root-children`, `rb-ts-list-nodes`, and `rb-ts-get-nodes` using the multi-form fixture to assert line/kind/hash/preview metadata, preview customization, and ordering expectations.
- Verified that `rb-ts-get-nodes` reports a helpful error when a requested line has no matching node.
- Guarded all new tests with `skip-unless (treesit-ready-p 'elisp t)` so the suite stays green even when Tree-sitter support is missing.

Lessons learned:
- The existing pure helpers already behave deterministically when walking roots, which made the tests easy to reason about and kept the fixtures concise.
