Document the exact behavior expected from insert_before_regex and insert_after_regex. Cover argument validation (path exists, regex string, optional line, verify ripgrep default syntax, new_text string, validate flag). Describe how each tool finds the closest match to :line when regex matches multiple times (use minimum absolute distance, prefer earlier match on tie), how insertions happen relative to the matched line, and how failures are reported (missing file, no match, multiple equidistant matches, regex ambiguity). Specify that edits occur in a temporary buffer and are applied atomically, and that :validate t triggers a Tree-sitter reparse before overwriting the file with the new contents. Detail the expected return structure (:inserted t). Add notes about ripgrep regex expectations for the docstrings and tool descriptions.
