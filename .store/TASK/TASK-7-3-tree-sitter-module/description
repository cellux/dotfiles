Move all Tree-sitter-related code from `rb-tools.el` into a new module `rb-tools-ts.el`. This includes the major-mode-to-language map, the parser wrapper (`rb-tools--ts-with-root`), node validation/selection helpers, `rb-tools-ts-list-nodes`/`-get-nodes`/`-update-nodes`, the relative insert helpers, and any defvars shared with other modules (format-function hook, IO injection points). Port the associated ERT coverage (node formatting, selection, update, insert before/after) into this module (or a companion test file) so the logic remains verified. The module must `require` the dependencies it needs, `provide` itself, and be required from `rb-tools.el` so GPTel tools continue to call the relocated functions without altering their signatures.
