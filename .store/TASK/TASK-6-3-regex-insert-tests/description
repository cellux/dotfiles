Add ERT coverage for `insert_before_regex` and `insert_after_regex` within `rb-tools-test.el`. Use temporary fixture files to cover happy paths (inserting before and after a unique marker, selecting the match closest to an explicitly supplied anchor line when multiple matches exist, and verifying the regex syntax aligns with ripgrep’s default Rust flavor) as well as failure modes (regex not found, ambiguous matches, validation failure). Ensure the tests confirm the tools operate in a temporary buffer, respect the `:validate` flag by re-parsing with Tree-sitter when requested, and leave files untouched when validation fails.
