Add ERT coverage for insert_before_regex and insert_after_regex within rb-tools-test.el. Use temporary fixture files to cover happy paths (before and after insertions, selecting the match closest to an explicitly supplied anchor line when multiple matches exist, and verifying the chosen regex syntax is compatible with ripgrep’s default mode) as well as failure modes (regex not found, ambiguous matches, validation failure). Ensure tests verify the tools operate in a temporary buffer, respect the :validate flag by re-parsing with Tree-sitter when requested, and leave files untouched when validation fails.
