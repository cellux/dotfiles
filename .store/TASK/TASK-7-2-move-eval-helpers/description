Create `rb-tools-eval.el` that contains `rb-tools--truthy?`, the Clojure/Elisp/Bash evaluation helpers, and any supporting declarations. Move any existing tests that exercise these helpers into the same file (or a companion `-test` file) so the module is self-contained. Ensure the module `provide`s itself, documents its API, and is required by `rb-tools.el` before the GPTel tool definitions that rely on these functions so the exported tools continue to work without changes.
