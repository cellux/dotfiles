Add ERT coverage for each new module in its respective file. This entails moving or creating tests that exercise the evaluation helpers, Tree-sitter workflows, IO/regex utilities, and object store schema logic so they live adjacent to their implementation. Each module should document how to run its tests (e.g., via `ert-run-tests-interactively`) and provide any necessary helpers for isolation (temp dirs/files). Ensure the tests continue to pass after the split and update or add new ones as required to cover the relocated APIs.
