Add docstrings/comments for insert_before_regex and insert_after_regex that explicitly mention the ripgrep default regex syntax expectation and describe their arguments/return values/failure modes. Create ERT tests exercising both tools: empty file insert, multiple matches with :line prioritization, validation success/failure, ripgrep regex edge cases, and confirmation that no write happens on validation failure. Mock ripgrep output if needed so tests remain hermetic. Also update any relevant documentation (README, tool list) to mention the new tools and when to use them.
